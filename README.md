# Dog-Shelter-Project
In this project, you will need to code a program to control the dogs that are in X shelter in Texas. Your program will allow the users to

• Assign/modify a dog's information (only weight)

• Change dogs between slots • Display a list of dogs (only weight)

• Close the shelter (clear all the dogs' weights)

Your program has to manage two global variables: the array containing the dogs' weight as gWeight and the gShelterSize that will be used to know how many dogs are in the shelter. Additionally, it will use a single Scanner as a global constant named gIN and a global constant of gMAX_DOGS equal to 100 for the maximum number of dogs allowed in the shelter.
